## Short story behind BlockStarter

BlockStarter is one of my pet projects. It took me ~ 10 days to complete all the basic functionalities..

This is not a commercial application, and with that in mind, I would like to point out that it was not built to be infinitelly scalable.

It is a frontend heavy project, attached to a [simple smart contract](https://github.com/Ninjaneer87/blockstarter-web3) placed on the GOERLI TESTNET.

I got the idea from a youtube video, so I made it a challenge to beat the teacher and make it with a next level UI, UX and a lot more functionalities.
